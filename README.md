## Abstract
Untargeted mass spectrometry is employed to detect small molecules in complex biospecimens, generating data that are difficult to interpret. We developed Qemistree, a data exploration strategy based on hierarchical organization of molecular fingerprints predicted from fragmentation spectra, represented in the context of sample metadata and chemical ontologies. By expressing molecular relationships as a tree, we can apply ecological tools, designed around the relatedness of DNA sequences, to study chemical composition.
